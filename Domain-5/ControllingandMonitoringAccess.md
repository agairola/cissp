## Comparing Access Control Models

The method of authorizing subjects to access objects varies depending on the access control method used by the IT system.

### Comparing Permissions, Rights and Privileges  

**Permissions** In general, permissions refer to the access granted for an object and determine what you can do with it. If you have read permission for a file, youâ€™ll be able to open it and read it. You can grant user permissions to create, read, edit, or delete a file on a file server.

**Rights** A right primarily refers to the ability to take an action on an object. For example, a user might have the right to modify the system time on a computer or the right to restore backed-up data.

**Privileges** Privileges are the combination of rights and permissions. For example, an administrator for a computer will have full privileges, granting the administrator full rights and permissions on the computer. The administrator will be able to perform any actions and access any data on the computer.
