Disaster recovery planning (DRP) is the technical complement to the business-focused BCP exercise. It includes the technical controls that prevent disruptions and facilitate the restoration of service as quickly as possible after a disruption occurs.

## The Nature of Disaster

A disaster recovery plan should be set up so that it can almost run on `autopilot`. The DRP should also be designed to `reduce decision-making` activities during a disaster as much as possible. Essential personnel should be `well trained` in their duties and responsibilities in the wake of a disaster and also know the steps they need to take to get the organization up and running as soon as possible. We’ll begin by analyzing some of the possible disasters that might strike your organization and the particular threats that they pose.

### Natural Disaster

A disaster recovery plan should provide mechanisms for responding to both types of disasters, either with a gradual buildup of response forces or as an immediate reaction to a rapidly emerging crisis.

> Note: Ensure that your organization has sufficient insurance in place to protect it from the financial impact of a flood under FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program.

#### Earthquakes

  * More likely to occur along known fault lines that exist in many areas of the world. A well-known example is the San Andreas Fault (Wester US).

  * If you live in a region along a fault line where earthquakes are likely, your DRP should address the procedures your business will implement should a seismic event interrupt your normal activities.

#### Floods

  * Some flooding results from the `gradual accumulation` of rainwater in rivers, lakes, and other bodies of water that then overflow their banks and flood the community. Other floods, known as `flash floods`, strike when a sudden severe storm dumps more rainwater on an area than the ground can absorb in a short period of time. Floods can also occur when `dams are breached`. Large waves caused by seismic activity, or `tsunamis`, combine the awesome power and weight of water with flooding, as we saw during the 2011 tsunami in Japan ([Fukushima](http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/fukushima-accident.aspx)).
