## Managing Incident Response

Regardless of best efforts incident do occur. The primary goal of incident response is to minimize the impact on the organization.

### Defining an Incident

A computer security incident (sometimes called just security incident) commonly refers to an incident that is the result of an attack, or the result of malicious or intentional actions on the part of users. For example, request for comments (RFC) 2350, “Expectations for Computer Security Incident Response,” defines both a security incident and a computer security incident as “**any adverse event which compromises some aspect of computer or network security.**” National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) special publication (SP) 800-61 “Computer Security Incident Handling Guide” defines a computer security incident as “**a violation or imminent threat of violation of computer security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard security practices.**” [NIST documents, including SP 800-61, can be accessed from the NIST publications page](https://csrc.nist.gov/Publications).

Within the CISSP Security Operations domain, the “Conduct incident management” objective is clearly referring to computer security incidents.

An organization normally classify security incidents as:
* Any attempted network intrusion
* Any attempted denial-of-service attack
* Any detection of malicious software
* Any unauthorized access of data
* Any violation of security policies

### Incident response steps

Note: Incident response does not include a counterattack against the attacker, as most of the time its illegal and plus attacker would be spoofing identity behind a innocent user.
