## Categories of Laws

### CRIMINAL LAW

* Criminal law forms the bedrock of the body of laws that preserve the peace and keep our society safe.

* Criminal law contains prohibitions against acts such as murder, assault, robbery, and arson.

* Penalties - mandatory hours of community service, monetary penalties in the form of fines (small and large), and deprivation of civil liberties in the form of prison sentences.

* Criminal laws Example:

  * Computer Fraud and Abuse Act
  * Electronic Communications Privacy Act
  * Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act

### CIVIL LAW

* Civil laws form the bulk of our body of laws.

* They are designed to provide for an orderly society and govern matters that are not crimes but that require an impartial arbiter to settle between individuals and organizations.

* Example: contract disputes, real estate transactions, employment matters, and estate/probate procedures

> At the federal level, both criminal and civil laws are embodied in the United States Code (USC).

* The `major difference between civil laws and criminal laws` is the way in which they are enforced. Usually, law enforcement authorities `do not become involved` in matters of `civil law` beyond taking action necessary to restore order. In a `criminal prosecution`, the government, through law enforcement investigators and prosecutors, `brings action against` a person accused of a crime.

### ADMINISTRATIVE LAW

* Executive branch agencies have some leeway to enact administrative law, in the form of policies, procedures, and regulations that govern the daily operations of the agency.

* Administrative law covers topics as mundane as the procedures to be used within a federal agency to obtain a desk telephone to more substantial issues such as the immigration policies that will be used to enforce the laws passed by Congress. Administrative law is published in the `Code of Federal Regulations`, often referred to as the `CFR`.
