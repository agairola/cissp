## Categories of Laws

### CRIMINAL LAW

* Criminal law forms the bedrock of the body of laws that preserve the peace and keep our society safe.

* Criminal law contains prohibitions against acts such as murder, assault, robbery, and arson.

* Penalties - mandatory hours of community service, monetary penalties in the form of fines (small and large), and deprivation of civil liberties in the form of prison sentences.

* Criminal laws Example:

  * Computer Fraud and Abuse Act
  * Electronic Communications Privacy Act
  * Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act

### CIVIL LAW

* Civil laws form the bulk of our body of laws.

* They are designed to provide for an orderly society and govern matters that are not crimes but that require an impartial arbiter to settle between individuals and organizations.

* Example: contract disputes, real estate transactions, employment matters, and estate/probate procedures

> At the federal level, both criminal and civil laws are embodied in the United States Code (USC).

* The `major difference between civil laws and criminal laws` is the way in which they are enforced. Usually, law enforcement authorities `do not become involved` in matters of `civil law` beyond taking action necessary to restore order. In a `criminal prosecution`, the government, through law enforcement investigators and prosecutors, `brings action against` a person accused of a crime.

### ADMINISTRATIVE LAW

* Executive branch agencies have some leeway to enact administrative law, in the form of policies, procedures, and regulations that govern the daily operations of the agency.

* Administrative law covers topics as mundane as the procedures to be used within a federal agency to obtain a desk telephone to more substantial issues such as the immigration policies that will be used to enforce the laws passed by Congress. Administrative law is published in the `Code of Federal Regulations`, often referred to as the `CFR`.

## Laws

### COMPUTER CRIME

#### Computer Fraud and Abuse Act

The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) was the first major piece of cybercrime-specific legislation in the United States. Congress had earlier enacted computer crime law as part of the `Comprehensive Crime Control Act (CCCA)` of 1984, but CFAA was carefully written to exclusively cover computer crimes that crossed state boundaries to avoid infringing on states’ rights and treading on thin constitutional ice. 

#### CFAA Amendments

In 1994, Congress recognized that the face of computer security had drastically changed since the CFAA was last amended in 1986 and made a number of sweeping changes to the act.

Example: 

Modified the CFAA to cover any computer used in interstate commerce rather than just “federal interest” computer systems

Since the initial CFAA amendments in 1994, Congress passed additional amendments in 1996, 2001, 2002, and 2008 as part of other cybercrime legislation

#### Federal Sentencing Guidelines

The Federal Sentencing Guidelines released in 1991 provided punishment guidelines to help federal judges interpret computer crime laws. Three Major Provision:

* The guidelines formalized the *prudent man rule*, which requires senior executives to take personal responsibility for ensuring the due care that ordinary, prudent individuals would exercise in the same situation.

* minimize punishment for infractions (a violation or infringement of a law or agreement.) by demonstrating that they used `due diligence` in the conduct of their information security duties.

* burdens of proof for negligence.
